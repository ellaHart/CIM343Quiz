# CIM343Quiz

Assignment Content
Question <bdi></bdi>
In this project, we we’ll try to use JavaScript’s building blocks in clever ways, building an algorithm for a guessing game (like a quiz or similar game, etc). 



You can customize the code for the quiz we have live-coded during classes. If you wish to develop another kind of game (like a slot machine, or memory game, you’re welcome to). 



The goal of this assignment is to get you familiar with basic building blocks of JavaScript (like these examples below).

• variables → let name = …

• text → let result = "Correct!"

• numbers → let counter = 0

• lists → let fruits = ["Pear","Apple","Raspberry"]

• conditions → if (…) { … }

• loops → for ( … of … ) { … }

• functions → function show() { … }

• events → button.onclick = show



Submit:

• Link to website (hosted on Github Pages, CodeSandbox, StackBlitz, Webflow, etc)

• Screen captures or a video recording of you interacting with your guessing game





P.S. If you decide to do this project in pairs, both students will receive the same grade
